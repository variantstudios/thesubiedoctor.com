  page_description: "This 2005 Subaru Impreza RS Wagon is one solid and clean ride with only 80,519 miles. What?? No, really!!\n\nThe Interior is very clean and damage free. Power windows, locks and power mirrors, 2 keys and key fobs all work correctly. A Pioneer CD/stereo with USB and Aux-in replaced the factory unit. It has All-Weather rubber floor mats, split fold rear seats, and a retractable cargo cover.\n\nThe exterior has received some cosmetic work to freshen it up, some paint touch up and body repair were performed. There’s factory roof rails and cross bars, the headlights are clear, fog lights were added (proper factory parts and wiring) and new tires were put on, even a clean windshield.\_\n\nMechanically the car received a thorough inspection and then we completed a timing component service including belts, pulleys, idlers, tensioner, thermostat, gasket, and water pump, new spark plugs, new brake pads and rotors, new oil and oil filter.\_\n\nAlthough the car is Rebuilt from a Salvage Title (the cause of Salvage was body damage, we do have pics of the damage prior to rebuild available) it has been carefully rebuilt by The Subie Doctor, VIN inspected by the Colorado State Patrol, and retitled by Adams County, and passed emissions. It is ready to register today.\_\n\nWe extensively road tested to ensure safety and reliability for years to come. It’s a solid, inexpensive and reliable car. Call, text or email to set up a test drive today!\n\n*selling price does not include tax\n*NO DEALER FEES"
