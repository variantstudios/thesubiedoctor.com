Another RS has been brought back to life thanks to The Subie Doctor. Our "Save the RS" program has done wonders for this patient, and it's ready for a new home. After examination The Doctor prescribed the following:

* &nbsp;A fresh coat of Aspen White Paint was applied
* A replacement EJ25 long block with 117k miles that was mechanically sound
* Heads were machined and rebuilt
* New head gaskets, valve cover gaskets and seals used for the rebuild
* New timing belt kit, water pump and thermostat installed
* New KYB struts on all 4 corners and alignment
* Emissions test complete

The car runs smooth, and drives straight and quiet. It's a great example of a classic Subaru and it's ready for many miles with it;s new owner.<br><br>Visit The Subie Doctor to become a valuable part of the Save the RS program today.
