    Used 2004 Ford Focus SVT Hatchback Euro Package for sale in Denver Colorado
    at The Subie Doctor
  page_description: >-
    We know, this is not a Subaru. It's ok... here at The Subie Doctor we
    appreciate all cars that can handle dirt and tarmac equally well and this
    2004 Ford Focus SVT with the European Appearance Package would make an
    excellent choice for daily driving, AutoCross or RallyCross. 


    This was a limited production vehicle with only 3,057 total produced in 2004
    (of those only 1,978 were 3 door and of those only 121 were Competition
    Orange). The SVT offered Recaro seats, a 170hp Zetec DOHC 4cyl motor, Getrag
    6 speed transmission with short shift, and an SVT tuned suspension making an
    excellent recipe for a driver's car. The 17 x 7 SVT wheels are currently
    shod in Hankook iPike winter tires with a few seasons left on them. There
    are additional accessories available to enjoy the car safely as a race
    vehicle such as: a Massive harness bar and Corbeau driver 4 point harness,
    extra wheels, a set of 4 street and a set of 4 gravel rally tires and even a
    few spare parts just in case. Track day cometh and you can be ready
    quickly! 


    The car has been adult owned, driven and maintained. Despite 160k on the
    odometer the car is in top notch condition. We treated it to a full
    assortment of Meguiar's Car Care products to restore the lustre of the
    paint, leather and trim. We also addressed a troublesome head gasket and
    cooling issue when the mechanical portion was inspected to ensure trouble
    free motoring. This excellent example of a Euro style Hot Hatch is ready for
    a new pilot for years of autobahn driving enjoyment. Come test drive it
    today!
