The Subie Doctor is a premier automotive repair shop and seller, specializing in Subaru vehicles. From the daily driver you brave to the mountains on the weekends, to your full blown rally/race cars, and everything in between, our shop has you and your Subaru's needs covered!  We also specialize in the JDM imports that are slowly trickling into the USA from across the oceans, we can get it inspected and serviced to make sure it's ready to hit the roads safely and reliably!

Our experienced and knowledgeable technicians are not only committed to providing the highest quality repairs and maintenance services available, but they are also Subaru factory trained technicians. We are also one of the few independent shops that have and use the SSM computer, which is a computer that only Subaru dealerships have, that enables us to quickly diagnose and repair any issues on your Subaru.

We have deep roots in rally racing and our employees' immersion in the racing and Subaru community make us the perfect choice for any modified Subaru. All of the employees here are Subaru enthusiasts at heart, whether we daily them or race them on the weekends, we all have a passion for the brand and you'll see that once you walk through the front door! No matter the model, or year of your Subaru, we take pride in our work and always strive to provide the best customer experience possible.
