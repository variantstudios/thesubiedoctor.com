### **Reconditioned Subaru Auto Sales**

&nbsp;All of our Subies have been fully inspected and all issues addressed. &nbsp;Many of our vehicles receive new head gaskets, timing belts and water pumps and some offer newly rebuilt engines with warranty.

### **Major Subaru Repairs**

##### *We specialize in large repair jobs such as:*



**Head gasket replacement**<br>An all too common repair on Subaru’s. &nbsp;Symptoms of a head gasket issue are an oil or coolant leak, oil in the coolant or most common, an overheating issue. &nbsp;Anywhere from 100k to 200k, they will need to be replaced. &nbsp;We only use premium Six Star MLS (multi-layer steel) head gaskets and re-surface the cylinder heads which is a critical step as Subaru heads do warp slightly which is the main reason for gasket failure.&nbsp;

**Timing belt and water pump replacement**<br>These are scheduled maintenance items. &nbsp;A timing belt or pulley failure will damage the engine valves and make for a much larger repair bill. &nbsp;Don’t put it off. &nbsp;Most models require replacement every 105k miles. We only use OEM timing belt kits as aftermarket ones lack the high quality of OEM.

**Turbo replacement**<br>Your turbo engine may last 200k+ but that turbo won’t. &nbsp;If you suspect a turbo problem (odd noise, high oil consumption or leak), have it checked out before a failure damages your entire engine. Many times you can prevent an engine failure by catching early signs of a failing turbo!

**Clutch replacement**<br>Clutch travel has gotten worse, RPM needle shooting up (without your car moving faster) or strange noises only when the pedal is out? &nbsp;Let’s get that taken care of and have your clutch feeling like new again.

**Engine replacement or rebuilding**<br>Engine knocking? &nbsp;We stock newly rebuilt replacement engines at very competitive pricing to get you back on the road quickly. &nbsp;We also offer used engines for the budget conscious customer with new head gaskets, timing belt and water pump for piece of mind. &nbsp;We offer new OEM blocks, Skyline Motors, IAG, Outfront Motorsports, M45 and others for new options whether it's a turbo or non turbo motor.&nbsp; Used engines can also be installed and come with varying warranties that can range from 30 days up to 1yr (ask about extended engine warranties)!&nbsp;

**Transmission replacement or rebuilding**<br>Automatic transmission starting to slip or manual trans gears starting to grind? &nbsp;Maybe the front differential is binding in tight turns? &nbsp;We can install a good used replacement or have your transmission rebuilt.&nbsp;

## Minor Subaru Repairs

***We also handle minor repair jobs such as:***

**Brakes**<br>Brakes squeaking, grinding or just don’t feel right? &nbsp;We can inspect both your front and rear brake pads to determine how much life is left and also check your brake rotors for warping, hot spots and grinding/scarring.

**Strut replacement**<br>An often overlooked area, worn out struts can make a car bouncy and tend to sway in turns and during quick lane changes. &nbsp;Bad struts will make a car unstable at highway speeds.&nbsp; We offer OEM replacement or the enhanced aftermarket options for your offroad and track use subies!

**Wheel bearings**<br>Have a roaring sound from one of the wheels? &nbsp;That's a dry and worn out wheel bearing and can be a huge safety concern.

**Axle replacement**<br>Axle boots crack and split and then throw all their lubrication grease onto everything around them. We can replace with a new OEM unit or rebuild using OE assemblies.&nbsp;

**Radiator replacement**<br>Factory radiators are plastic which in this dry climate tend to get brittle and crack and Subaru engines are very sensitive to overheating and damage can be done very quickly.&nbsp; We offer OE spec replacement or can upgrade to a full aluminum radiator which is less prone to the failure of the stock plastic styles.

**Scheduled maintenance**<br>Want the Subaru scheduled maintenance done but don’t want to pay dealer service pricing? &nbsp;We can take care of that. We offer all mile intervals, the main ones you don't want to miss are: 30k, 60k, 90/100k, 120k and beyond!

**Tune-ups**<br>Car running sluggish or gas mileage down? A quick tune-up will take care of that. Spark plugs, spark plug wires, ignition coils, and even fuel treatment can all help improve your car's performance and gas mileage!

**Emissions repairs**<br>Failed an emissions test? &nbsp;We have you covered. All we need is your failed emissions slip and we can help you get your vehicle to pass, we even offer the an option to take the car to the emissions test ourselves so you don't have to worry doing it your own.

**Check engine light**<br>That pesky check engine light on again? &nbsp;It won’t go away itself, have us check it out, it might be a quick fix. &nbsp;Colorado emissions stations will now fail a vehicle if that light is on.

**AC service**<br>We can leak test, repair and recharge your AC system.&nbsp; Usually a simple recharge will fix the issue, sometimes there can be a leaky hose or valve as well which we can replace and have you chill as a cucumber for those summer months!

**Other Subaru Services**

**Tire sales & service**<br>We carry most tire brands and can recommend you the best tire option for your lifestyle needs!&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Theft prevention**<br>Subaru thefts are on the rise. &nbsp;We offer kill switch and alarm installations.&nbsp; Denver has been one of the top, if not the \#1 rated city for automobile theft in the entire US!&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Vehicle inspections**<br>We offer thorough pre-purchase and pre-road trip vehicle inspections for that piece of mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Performance Upgrades**<br>Whether you are looking for some bolt-on engine mods, suspension upgrades or an STi and JDM engine or full drivetrain swaps, we can help. We specialize in GC swaps.
