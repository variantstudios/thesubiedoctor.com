### **Reconditioned Subaru Auto Sales**

&nbsp;All of our Subies have been fully inspected and all issues addressed. &nbsp;Many of our vehicles receive new head gaskets, timing belts and water pumps and some offer newly rebuilt engines with warranty.

### **Major Subaru Repairs**

##### *We specialize in large repair jobs such as:*

**Head gasket replacement**<br>An all too common repair on Subaru’s. &nbsp;Symptoms or a head gasket issue are an oil or coolant leak, oil in the coolant or most common, an overheating issue. &nbsp;Anywhere from 100k to 200k, they will need to be replaced. &nbsp;We only use premium Six Star head gaskets and re-surface the cylinder heads which is a critical step as Subaru heads do warp slightly which is the main reason for gasket failure.

**Timing belt and water pump replacement**<br>These are scheduled maintenance items. &nbsp;A timing belt or pulley failure will damage the engine valves and make for a much larger repair bill. &nbsp;Don’t put it off. &nbsp;Most models require replacement every 105k miles.

**Turbo replacement**<br>Your turbo engine may last 200k+ but that turbo won’t. &nbsp;If you suspect a turbo problem (odd noise, high oil consumption or leak), have it checked out before a failure damages your entire engine.

**Clutch replacement**<br>Clutch travel gotten worse, strange noise only when the pedal is out? &nbsp;Let’s get that taken care of.

**Engine replacement or rebuilding**<br>Engine knocking? &nbsp;We stock newly rebuilt replacement engines at very competitive pricing to get you back on the road quickly. &nbsp;We also offer used engines for the budget conscious customer with new head gaskets, timing belt and water pump for piece of mind. &nbsp;Rebuilt engines come with a 12k miles or 1 year warranty. &nbsp;Used engines come with a 3k or 90 day warranty.

**Transmission replacement or rebuilding**<br>Automatic transmission starting to slip or manual trans gears starting to grind? &nbsp;Maybe the front differential is binding in tight turns? &nbsp;We can install a good used replacement or have your transmission rebuilt.

## Minor Subaru Repairs

***We also handle minor repair jobs such as:***

**Brakes**<br>Brakes squeaking or grinding or just don’t feel right? &nbsp;We offer free brake inspections

**Strut replacement**<br>An often overlooked area, worn out struts can make a car bouncy and tend to sway in turns and during quick lane changes. &nbsp;Bad struts will make a car unstable at highway speeds

**Wheel bearings**<br>Have a roaring sound from one of the wheels? &nbsp;That a dry and worn out wheel bearing

**Axle replacement**<br>Axle boots crack and split and then throw all their lubrication grease onto everything around them.

**Radiator replacement**<br>Factory radiators are plastic which in this dry climate tend to get brittle and crack and Subaru engines are very sensitive to overheating and damage can be done very quickly

**Scheduled maintenance**<br>Want the Subaru scheduled maintenance done but don’t want to pay dealer service pricing? &nbsp;We can take care of that.

**Tune-ups**<br>Car running sluggish or gas mileage down? A quick tune-up will take care of that.

**Emissions repairs**<br>Failed an emissions test? &nbsp;We have you covered.

**Check engine light**<br>That pesky check engine light on again? &nbsp;It won’t go away itself, have us check it out, it might be a quick fix. &nbsp;Colorado emissions stations will now fail a vehicle if that light is on.

**AC service**<br>We can leak test, repair and recharge your AC system

**Other Subaru Services**

**Tire sales & service**<br>We carry most tire brands and use the latest technology tire mounting and balancing equipment to protect your rims

**Theft prevention**<br>Subaru thefts are on the rise. &nbsp;We offer kill switch and alarm installations

**Vehicle inspections**<br>We offer thorough pre-purchase and pre-road trip vehicle inspections for that piece of mind
