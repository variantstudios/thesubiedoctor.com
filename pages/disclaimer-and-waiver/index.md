COVID-19 Disclaimer and Waiver.

I acknowledge, understand, and agree that any in-person interaction may expose me to a communicable disease, including but not limited to, the virus “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)”, which is responsible for the Coronavirus Disease (commonly known as COVID-19) and any mutation or variation thereof. I further acknowledge and understand the seriousness of being exposed to COVID-19 and the health complications it can cause.

I, for myself and on behalf of my heirs, assigns, and personal representatives, hereby declare that I bring my vehicle to the Company of my own free will and I voluntarily assume the risks involved in personal interactions with others and further release, indemnify, and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers, employees, agents, independent contractors, and volunteers from any and all claims, demands, losses, and liability, of any kind or character, arising out of or related to any illness, injury, disability or death I may suffer by bringing my vehicle to the Company for services, whether due to negligence or otherwise, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
