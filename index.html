<p>The Subie Doctor specializes in reconditioned Subaru auto sales, repair and rebuilding services.  With proper maintenance, Subaru's have been known to hit 300,000 miles but they often need some reconditioning work to achieve that milestone.  That's where the Subie Doctor can help.  This business was built on referrals by being professional and honest, offering exceptional value and standing behind our work.  All our repairs and re-conditioning services are warrantied for 12k miles or 1 year.</p>

Check out our Sales Inventory for our current and coming soon vehicles.</p>
